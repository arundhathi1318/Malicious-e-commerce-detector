Realtime Malicious E-Commerce Website Detector
Overview
The Realtime Malicious E-Commerce Website Detector is a Python-based browser extension designed to safeguard users from malicious or deceptive shopping websites. By leveraging machine learning models, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques, the extension evaluates shopping websites in real time to detect and highlight misleading or potentially harmful elements.

Features
Browser Integration: Developed as an easy-to-use browser extension for seamless integration.
Machine Learning Analysis: Utilized Scikit-learn models for predicting website trustworthiness.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Extracted and analyzed textual elements directly from webpage images using OpenCV.
NLP-Powered Insights: Scanned and scored website text for deceptive language patterns using NLTK.
Real-time Alerts: Provided instant feedback to users about a website's trustworthiness.
User-Friendly Interface: Highlighted suspicious elements for quick identification.
How It Works
Data Collection:

Fetched textual and image content from shopping websites.
Processed image-based content using OCR (via OpenCV) to extract embedded text.
Feature Extraction:

Used NLP techniques to identify patterns associated with misleading claims or fraud (e.g., overly promotional language, fake reviews).
Extracted visual and textual features to score suspicious behavior.
Machine Learning Model:

Trained a classification model using Scikit-learn to label websites as "Safe" or "Malicious."
Features included metadata, textual patterns, and image-based content analysis.
Browser Extension:

Integrated the detection engine into a browser extension.
Delivered real-time warnings and visual highlights of questionable website elements.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
Natural Language Processing: NLTK
OCR and Computer Vision: OpenCV
Deployment: Packaged as a browser extension compatible with popular web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Installation and Usage
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Browser supporting extensions (e.g., Chrome).
Installation Steps
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/malicious-website-detector.git  
cd malicious-website-detector  
Install required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Set up the browser extension:

Load the extension folder into your browser.
Usage
Navigate to any e-commerce website.
The extension will automatically scan the webpage and display a trust score.
Suspicious elements will be highlighted for easy identification.
Dataset and Training
Dataset Sources:
Public datasets of malicious and safe websites.
Scraped data from e-commerce platforms (manually labeled).
Training Process:
Cleaned and preprocessed data using NLTK for text analysis.
Extracted features using a mix of image processing (OpenCV) and metadata analysis.
Trained a supervised learning model using Scikit-learn.
Results and Performance
Achieved 95% accuracy on the test set.
Detected various patterns of deception, such as:
Fake discounts.
Fraudulent product claims.
Misleading text embedded in images.
Future Improvements
Support for additional languages for NLP analysis.
Advanced deep learning models for better detection accuracy.
Enhanced UI/UX for a more intuitive extension experience.
